By connecting to the server we are rapid fired with questions with different decoding questions.
This rapid fire is too quick for us to manually decode, and submit, so we need to write a script.

We are handed out *example.py* which we can add code to to solve the task 
(both the example file, and the finished script is in the same directory as this file)

After running the python script we get the flag

> python3 nc1.py | nc io.ept.gg 30023
